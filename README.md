I don't know JavaScript properly and that's not good. Okay, I'm able to do some scripting on a site, but I won't consider myself a JavaScript developer.

So I decided to create a little game using JavaScript and the `<canvas>` element. As my goal is to learn JavaScript, I'm trying not to use any existing framework or library (the only exception could be [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/), I'm not yet 100% sure about it...). Maybe I will write code already written, maybe existing code will be better than mine, but I have my goal. This is just a hobby project, so may the Don't-reinvent-the-wheel-gods forgive me.

As I -right now- don't know that much about idiomatic JavaScript, my code might be a little sloppy here and there, maybe it will even hurt your eyes. Bear with me, I will give my best to change it, but I'm one of those "Make it work, then make it pretty"-guys.
